Hello! This is my nav bar! I started this assignment by watching you set your nav bar up in class. Once I had the shell of my nav bar, I found some colors that went together well and made some round cutsie buttons. The project went pretty smoothly up until I decided to add a search bar. This search bar was the bane of my existance. I tried probably every flex command on this thing, I tried making it a div instead of a li, I tried giving it a class, I tried targeting it using the "last-child" stuff. I eventually gave up figuring it out on my own and asked ChatGPT what I was doing wrong and it said to use "margin-left: "auto";" so I did that. Now it's on the right but I sadly cannot get it to flex the way I would like it to flex. I debated taking it out but honestly I think it adds something and I will continue messing with it after the assignment. Overall I think this mini-project went very well and helped me learn a lot about how flex containers work and overall will be very useful as I progress as a web-designer!
