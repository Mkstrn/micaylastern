Please detail your process, any people you may have worked with, specific tutorials that may have found useful, tales of your interactions with Chat GPT, or anything else you might want to document in the space below:


I began my journey with no sense of what I really wanted to do which I feel like you can definitely see in my work. I honestly need to research the specific type of things you can do with javascript. Throughout my search, I found three relatively easier things I could do: change it so that when the button is clicked, the counter appears on the screen, a functional clock, and allowing users to pick a background color for the website.

I found it relatively easy to change the counter to be viewed on the screen but a real challenge came with the clock. I used google's ai to give me multiple suggestions on how I could approach such a thing and it was very helpful. I ended up following their guide and it worked very well! I wish I could have gotten the clock to sit smaller and at the bottom of the screen but ultimately I was just happy that it worked and told our timezones correct time to the second. 

I used chatgpt to give me inspiration on what to do for my third javascrip activity and that is how I found the background customizer.

I think if I were to do this project again I would try to definitely make it more coheisive and to have a set goal in mind but overall I like that it introduced me to different things I can do with the code!
