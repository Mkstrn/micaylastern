Hello!

This mini project put me through it in total honesty. API's are really confusing HOWEVER I think that I am starting to understand. I went through a lot of ideas before landing on a starwars theme. Originally, I was going to create a goal organizing software, then a spotistats replica (I didn't want to pay for spotify's api haha), and then we landed on starwars.

I used a youtube video to base a lot of my work off of, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37vxWr0WgQk, I really like the way he went throught the code and explained himself. It was a lot like in class but it was a nice refresh. 

I attempted to make it so that the little character card had a few images such as movie posters and a character image however it turns out there just isn't an easy way to do that that I could find. SWAPI doesn't include images so I looked for a second api that did but it didn't work and then I tried using AI to help me get these images to work and it still wasn't helpful so I decided to leave them out. 

As far as styling goes, I got the "starwars yellow" from a design page, I wanted to keep the styling kind of simple. I did use AI to animate the stars on the page which, in my opinion, brought the whole look together. 

If I had more time I would have liked to make it so that if you typed in a "species" it would output all characters of that species.
